# Geometric Algorithms
*Explore efficient solutions for line intersection and convex hull computation.*

## Overview
Geometric Algorithms is a comprehensive project that implements, visualizes, and analyzes key geometric algorithms. The project centers on two core challenges:
- **Line Segment Intersection:** Featuring counter-clockwise (CCW) operations, vector cross product methods, and a line sweep algorithm.
- **Convex Hull Computation:** Implementing brute force, Jarvis-March, Graham Scan, Quick Hull, and Monotone Chain techniques.

This project targets developers, researchers, and enthusiasts in computational geometry, offering insightful performance comparisons and interactive visualizations that set it apart from similar projects.

## Technology Stack
- **Python 3.9+**
- **Tkinter** for GUI visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** for experimental analysis
- **LaTeX** for report generation (Algo_Report.tex)
- **Various Python libraries** for mathematical and graphical computations

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

### Installation Steps
1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/muhammadhamzagova666/geometric-algorithms.git
    cd GeoAlgorithms
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
   *(Ensure to create a `requirements.txt` with any necessary dependencies.)*

3. **Open the Jupyter Notebook for time complexity analysis:**
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook Source/Time_Complexity_Analysis.ipynb
    ```

## Usage Guide

- **Interactive GUI Demo:**  
  Run `python Source/Line_Intersection.py` to launch the Tkinter GUI and test line intersection methods visually.

- **Convex Hull Computation:**  
  Execute `python Source/Convex_Hull.py` to see the convex hull computation in action.

- **Documentation and Report:**  
  The full project report in LaTeX is available in Algo_Report.tex and can be compiled to generate a PDF.

## Configuration & Environment Variables
- **Configuration Files:**  
  If required, create a `.env` file at the project root for environment-specific settings.  
  Example `.env`:
  ```
  DEBUG=True
  LOG_LEVEL=INFO
  ```

## Deployment Guide
For simple deployment:
1. **Local Execution:**  
   Run the Python scripts locally as described in the usage guide.
2. **Docker Deployment (Optional):**  
   A sample `Dockerfile` can be created to containerize the application.
    ```dockerfile
    FROM python:3.9-slim
    WORKDIR /app
    COPY . /app
    RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
    CMD ["python", "Source/Line_Intersection.py"]
    ```
3. **CI/CD Integration:**  
   Add GitHub Actions workflows for testing and automatic deployment on push events.

## Testing & Debugging
- **Running Tests:**  
  Use pytest or unittest frameworks to run unit tests.
    ```sh
    pytest tests/
    ```
- **Debugging Tips:**  
  - Utilize logging in your Python scripts.
  - Run scripts in an IDE like Visual Studio Code for an interactive debugging experience.
  - Check the output and debug console for configuration issues.

## Performance Optimization
- Profile algorithms using Python’s `cProfile` module.
- Optimize critical functions with vectorized operations using libraries like NumPy.
- Consider caching results for repeated computations to boost performance.

## Security Best Practices
- Validate all input data to prevent unexpected errors.
- Use virtual environments to isolate dependencies.
- Regularly update dependencies to patch vulnerabilities.
